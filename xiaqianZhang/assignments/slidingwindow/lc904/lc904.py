# Problem Statement #

# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, 
# and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
# The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

# You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. 
# You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

Attempt 2:
Input: array of characters that contains dulicate character
output: return the max length of subarray that contains two different character
Initialize startIndex = 0, maxNum = 0, currentCount = {}
The directionary that used to count the appearence of the index, we don't want the size of the dictionary > 2

first by loop through the array and checking if the current index's character is in the dictionary:
  if so, append its count value by 0
  else: set its count value as 1
  within this for loop, we want to have the condition that if the size of the dictionary is greater than 2:
    set a variable for the start index in the dictionary
    then decrement the count of this index's character by 1
    if the count is equal to 0:
      remove the first key character in the dictionary
    increment the startIndex by 1
  update the maxNum = max bt(maxNum, currentIndex - startIndex + 1)
return maxNum
